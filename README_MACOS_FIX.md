# macOS Compilation Fix - August 21, 2025

## Problem Fixed
JuceHeader.h was trying to use system `<JuceHeader.h>` on macOS, but the project downloads JUCE to `/tmp/JUCE`. 

## Solution Applied
1. **Unified JUCE Path**: Both Linux and macOS now use `/tmp/JUCE` consistently
2. **Plugin Metadata**: Added all required JucePlugin_* defines that JUCE expects
3. **Namespace**: Using `juce` namespace for all JUCE classes
4. **Compatibility**: Linux-specific stubs only when needed

## Key Changes
- JuceHeader.h: Unified to use /tmp/JUCE on both platforms  
- Added complete JucePlugin_* metadata definitions
- Fixed String/Graphics/Button class availability 
- Maintained cross-platform compatibility

## Test Status
- âœ… Linux: Compiles with warnings (development mode)
- ðŸ”„ macOS: Should now compile correctly with downloaded JUCE

## Next Steps for User
Re-run build on macOS:
```bash
cd TunePro
./build_simple.sh
```

The project should now compile successfully on macOS with the downloaded JUCE framework.
